# Super Tic Tac Toe

## Abstract:
Tic-tac-toe is a common two player game played On a 3 x 3 grid, traditionally using X and O's as the markers. It is most often played during childhood. Super tic-tac-toe is my application, a Super Mario themed tic-tac-toe game. In Super tic-tac-toe you first enter your name and then you are can choose from four different characters each for player one and player two. After you click the “Lets A Go” button the game begins, allowing in alternating turns, with the banner above the game board telling you whose turn it is, to place the icon each player selected. On a win the winner's score will tick up by one, and on both a win and a draw the game will reset so you can play again.

## Context:

This project was completed as Turing School of Software and Design’s final solo project for module one. This project is one of the steps expected to demonstrate that we are ready to advance to module two. Tic-tac-toe is our first project that we have built entirely from the ground up alone from the planning stage through completion.

## Learning Goals:

The learning goals for this project were for us to solidify and demonstrate our understanding of both writing DRY JavaScript and also how to use event delegation to handle similar event listeners. We were expected to be able to understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM. Maybe most importantly we also needed to use our problem solving skills in order to break down large problems into more reasonable pieces, solve things procedurally and do that on our own in order to come to a logical answer.

## Wins + Challenges:

This might not be my biggest win, but it is certainly one thing that I am incredibly proud of on this project, I was able to use CSS to design a very aesthetically pleasing game board that was also fully functional. 

Both my biggest win and my biggest challenge was definitely implementing the ability to change the icons that The players use during their turns. 

One of my biggest challenges was figuring out how to use the ```setTimeout()``` function properly. I was having some issues where the ```setTimeout()``` would cause other functions to run at times that I didn't want them to, and I didn't know that that was something that could happen and so it led to a lot of confusion and trial and error trying to figure out what I needed to fix.
